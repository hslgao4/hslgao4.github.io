<p>I am currently a Master's student in Data Science at <a href="https://datasci.columbian.gwu.edu">Columbian College of Arts and Sciences</a> in <a href="https://www.gwu.edu">The George Washington University</a>, and I will graduate in December 2024. 
  My major courses include: <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong>, <strong>Time Serires Analysis & Modeling</strong>, <strong>Data Visualization</strong>, and <strong>Data Warehousing</strong>. 
Through these courses and related assignments and projects, I dived into data analysis using <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Pytorch</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, and <strong>R</strong>.  These project experience enhanced my ability to handle large datasets and extract meaningful insights.
<p>Before joinging GWU, I obtained a Master's degree in Finance from <a href="https://freeman.tulane.edu/graduate/master-finance">Freeman School of Business</a> at <a href="https://tulane.edu">Tulane University</a>. 
  Major courses include: 
  <strong>Risk Management</strong>, <strong>Financial Modeling</strong>, <strong>Fixed Income Analytics & Model</strong>, <strong>Equity Analysis</strong>, and <strong>Accounting Analytics</strong>,
  which equipped me with robust quantitative skills, enabling me to effectively analyze and interpret financial data.
  I had trained to use Excel to perform financial data analysis, building financial models, and make prediction, and also make professional business presentation. 
 
<p> I obtained my bachelor degrees from <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/management/">University of Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/international-business-school-suzhou">Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University</a>.<br />

<p><strong>Predicting temperature with regression and time-series models</strong><br /><br />
    In this individual term project, I utilized a dataset comprising 17,545 observations to forecaste temperature trends in Germany, 
    and employ advanced time series techniques including multiple linear regression and the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. 
    To capture the underlying trend and seasonal variations in temperature, I meticulously adjusted the parameters of these models, ensuring an enhanced sensitivity analysis. 
    This rigorous approach enabled me to achieve an exceptional adjusted R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.97, indicating a highly accurate fit of the model to the observed data.

  <p><strong>Biomedical image segmentation with CNN architecture</strong><br /><br />
    In this multi-organ biomedical image segmentation task, I used U-Net, a specialized convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, implemented within the PyTorch framework. My responsibilities encompassed preprocessing medical imaging data to ensure optimal input quality, implementing the model, and meticulously tuning the parameters to enhance its performance. Through these efforts, I achieved a high Dice coefficient of 0.93, indicating a very precise overlap between the segmentation results produced by the model and the ground truth, thereby underscoring the effectiveness of our approach in medical image analysis.

    <p><strong>AI Book recommendation system with Transformer</strong><br /><br />
      I developed an advanced book recommendation system by utilizing the Transformer architecture, specifically leveraging pre-trained BERT models. This system employed sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text from book reviews, significantly enhancing the accuracy of its recommendations. To make the system accessible and user-friendly, I also designed and implemented an interaction application using Streamlit. This application provided a seamless user experience, allowing users to easily interact with the system to find book recommendations tailored to their preferences.
